write a program to take texts and call the Google cloud NLP API and returns all
the wiki links and also person's organizations in a Json format.



Idea:

#For each entity,
#Topmost entry in knowledge graph (if type is person)

Format in proper Json

(keep trying to show works_for )

#Backup:

http://schema.org/Person  (works_for?) (is it possible to show more fields?)
Wiki links are already available
(add some more?)

Last resort:

Directly show knowledge graph entry for single query

Possible investigation:

#Q. Might NLP's content classification help?
#A. Probably not. Content classification needs at least 20 tokens.

Q. Entity analysis-knowledge graph entry?
A. Definitely worth a shot. Entity analysis works good with the Michael Caravaggio example.
